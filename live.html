<h2>What is Live Status of Train?</h2>
<p>Live train running status for Indian railway trains means the exact location of any train and its real time delay status. It may also include the estimated arrival of the train at any particular station en-route.

The two key things which are important to be noted while checking Live Train Status are "Last Reported Location" and "Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at upcoming stoppages"

The "Last Reported Station" signifies the station based on which the current live train running status is determined. The "Last Reported Station" also conveys that the train has either arrived or departed or crossed that particular station.</p>
